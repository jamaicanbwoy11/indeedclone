# Indeed Clone
The Indeed clone is a website that is created to look like a replica of the job board site, Indeed. When the user visits the Indeed clone site, they will be presented with the Indeed homepage and any recent job searched they have made. If the user has not made any recent job searches, or cleared their list of recent searches, the recent searches section tell the use that they have not made any recent searches. Recent searches that have been made is saved to the user's local storage which allows the recent searches to persist should the use exit the site and revisit at another time. Should the user wish to edit their list of recent searches, they are able to delete individual searches, or the entire list altogether.
